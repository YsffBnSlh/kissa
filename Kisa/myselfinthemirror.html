                        -so you have a problem.<br><br>
                        -sure i do, not sure that i wanna talk about it tho.<br><br>
                        -come on, it’s not like I’m a real character.<br><br>
                        -what is it like to be imaginary?<br><br>
                        -you won’t get it.<br><br>
                        -why not?<br><br>
                        -you’re free, you get to live a real life, to touch the grass, to play under the sun rays, to go in long walks under the rain in the middle of the night, you’re free to feel, so you’re free to live.
                         Somebody with those gifts can’t understand what is it like to be without them, no matter how hard you try you won’t understand, cause you didn’t had the chance to experience it.<br><br>
                        -you know that life isn’t only about playing under the sun rays and walking under the rain right?<br><br>
                        -why? what more do you want?<br><br>
                        -life is about working more than about having fun, you’ll have to work 8 hours a day to make enough money to pay rent, and if you worked harder, you’ll be able to go to a bar at the end of the weekend.
                         So don’t talk to me about “the gift of living” be more realistic.<br><br>
                        -poor you.<br><br>
                        -what?<br><br>
                        -you don’t even know what’s the meaning of life. You’re just living out of fear of dying, you’re just like those humans who doesn’t even have a dream, do you even have any reason to live?<br><br>
                        -well......I don’t know, but I know that if i die a lot of people will be sad.<br><br>
                        -that’s not enough, your life is missing a lot.<br><br>
                        -the truth is that my soul is melting. I’m feeling like in falling in an endless dark hole, and the problem is that I don’t know what’s the missing thing, and it’s driving me crazy.<br><br>
                        -life is really more about both taking risk and understanding art. There is two of everything, there is a right hand and a left hand, there is black and white, there is brain and soul,
                         there is good and bad, there are two persons in you, one of them likes taking risks in many different ways, and the other one is the artful one. He likes art in its endless different forms,
                         I’m not talking about paintings and theater, I’m talking about nature, creatures, everything around you. If you think about something that you see every day in a different way, you may even realize what is the meaning of your existence.
                        -It’s not that easy to think of stuff like that especially when your head is full of problems.<br><br>
                        -humans create their own problems and then complain about them. Why would you think about a problem that you already know the solution to it?<br><br>
                        -I don’t know the solution.<br><br>
                        -you can’t lie to me boy. We share the same mind remember?<br><br>
                        -but it’s doesn’t feel right.<br><br>
                        -there is no right and wrong, there is no good and bad, everything is just relative.<br><br>
                        -but you said that there is good and bad before.<br><br>
                        -yeah? Oh right. Who knows who’s memory was it...
